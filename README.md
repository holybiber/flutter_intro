# Workshop: introduction to flutter

## Description
Building beautiful applications for Android, iOS, web, desktop... with just a single code base? Sounds impressive and cost-efficient. Flutter is still young but already stable on all platforms. A new framework with a learning curve but well-designed and without all that baggage of older frameworks and programming languages.

In this workshop I'll give you an introduction and will show you: How does it feel like to develop with it?
Based on my own experience with developing the 4training.net app in last months I'll show you how to get started with dart and flutter and how to effectively develop with it: development environment, debugging, testing... Along the way I'll answer all the questions you have as good as I can.

Spoiler: I'm happy with my choice to use flutter for app development.

## Dart and flutter: the overview

## Quickstart: Getting a new project running
Prerequisites: Install Flutter SDK (including Dart SDK), Android Studio and IDE (in my example: VS Code).

Once that's done we can quickly get a first project running:
`flutter create flutter_intro`
`cd flutter_intro`
`flutter run`

Multi-platform made easy - let's try it out!
1. Linux
2. Chrome
3. Emulator (via VS Code)
4. Connect to smartphone
